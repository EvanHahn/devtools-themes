# Chrome Developer Tools Themes

A collection of themes for Chrome's Developer Tools.

The theme files are written in [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) and make use of
simple features such as variables, nested selectors, and mixins. This makes
adding your own custom theme much easier.

# Getting Started

In order to compile stylesheets, this project makes use of
[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/). This can easily be installed via
[npm](https://npmjs.org/). Npm is provided with most distributions of
[node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

To install Grunt: `npm install -g grunt`

Once you've installed Grunt, you'll need to ensure you have all of the Grunt
task dependencies.

To download these dependencies, run the following from the root of this project:
`npm install`

## Installation

Still working on this...

Run `grunt` to create your CSS file.

Depending on your platform, you'll need to install the `Custom.css` file into
your Chrome's User Stylesheet's directory:

* **Mac:** ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/User StyleSheets/Custom.css
* **PC:** C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\User StyleSheets\Custom.css ~Thanks to @vsc
* **Ubuntu (Chromium):** ~/.config/chromium/Default/User\ StyleSheets/Custom.css ~Thanks to @carlos
